# Project Description: 
The "Petshop Doguito" project is a product management system for a pet shop. It was developed using Node.js, Express.js, MySQL2, Sequelize, and other tools to ensure an efficient and scalable development environment.

The project structure is organized and modular, with folders dedicated to different aspects of the application. The "assets" folder contains JavaScript files responsible for front-end validation and interactivity logic. The "public" folder houses CSS files that define the visual style of the application, as well as images related to the products and the pet shop's visual identity.

The server is configured in the "server" directory, with separate files for general configurations, controllers for managing HTTP routes, and models for database interaction via Sequelize. The "src" folder contains HTML and EJS views that make up the different pages of the application, such as the product registration form, product listing, and confirmation pages for registration and updates.

In summary, "Petshop Doguito" is an application that allows users to register, view, edit, and remove products intuitively and efficiently, providing a friendly experience for pet shop users.
